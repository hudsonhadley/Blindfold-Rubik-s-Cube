# Blindfold-Rubik-s-Cube
# This is a set of programs to help somebody with solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Almost every method for solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded heavily relies on letter pairs, that is memorizing letters in pairs. For example, instead of memorizing the cube and all of its complexity, one could only memorize AB JE TJ HQ etc. and be able to solve the cube with a blindfold (this is reliant on the Speffz lettering scheme). To memorize these letter pairs, a common technique is to convert them into images. So, AL is now alien which is much easier to memorize. This program allows for a user to input a desired word for every letter pair and also has a quiz which can quiz someone on any set of letter pairs.
